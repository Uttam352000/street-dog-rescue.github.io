<h1>Animal Sheltering</h1><br>
	<div class="text">
<span class="number">1.</span> <span class="word">Home for Old aged animals:</span> For any living being old age is the time to relax and live peacefully
 without much hassle. It’s the time when senior strays are no more able to scavenge for food or
 adjust or fight with adverse conditions of staying on road so ARC tries to give shelter to as many
 senior dogs as possible, the senior ones who come here for treatment becomes a member of Arc family
 once after treatment period is over.<br><br>

<span class="number">2.</span> <span class="word">Home for physically challenged animals:</span> Physically challenged and paraplegic animals hardly get 
adopted and it is impossible for them to survive on roads. So ARC gives shelter to some of these 
special Childs to give them a better standard of living.<br><br>

<span class="number">3.</span> <span class="word">Home for abandoned Animals:</span> ARC gives shelter and treatment to many abandoned dogs and cats that are
 due to reasons unknown left to die on the roads and arranges for their adoption.<br><br>

<span class="number">4.</span> <span class="word">Home for those who have none:</span>  ARC becomes home for puppies that come for treatment and stay for
 more than two months as they won’t be able to adjust in their territories after such long span of
 time. They are up for adoption and till adopted they stay as loved members of ARC. Similarly for 
animals with terminal illness that will require lifelong care and medicines after initial treatment
 period also stay with us if not adopted.<br><br>
