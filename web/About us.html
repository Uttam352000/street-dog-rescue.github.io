<div class="title"><i><b>ABOUT US</i></b></div>
<div class="para">
<p><i>SAVE US is a kolkata based NGO registered under trust act in 2016 that has 
been working for the welfare of stray animals and their rights. Two individual animal lovers <span><b>Sneha 
Chatterjee</b></span> and <span><b>Uttam Karmakar</b></span> have been running this shelter cum hospital since 2014. The main 
objective of our organization is to create a better world for the voiceless friends by spreading 
awareness among people so that people live in harmony with the less privileged ones and defend their
 rights.</p>

<p>Our goal is to rescue animals those are ill or injured or animals those are subject to torture and 
abuse. We provide them relief, treatment adequate care and a safe Refuge. We also work relentlessly 
for adoption of those who are in need and giving them a safe future. We also try our best to give 
shelter to senior and differently abled street dogs.</p>

<p>We started our shelter within the small premises of our house only with a few rooms and a small 
kennel. But with the passing of time and increasing demand of welfare activities, we feel the 
urgency to expand very soon with a bigger shelter cum rehabilitation center.</p>

<p>We conduct regular and organized ABC programs, proper Vaccination, deworming and feeding drives with 
an aim that one day there will be no animal going to sleep with a hungry tummy or without a roof 
above his/her head.</p></i>
